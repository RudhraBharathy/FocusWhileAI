# ⏳ FocusWhileAI

> FocusWhileAI turns AI waiting time into intentional micro-engagement instead of distraction.

### **Why FocusWhileAI:**

We all do it: you ask ChatGPT or other LLMs a question, and while it generates, you instinctively open Twitter or Instagram and suddenly, 10 minutes are gone. FocusWhileAI fills that dangerous 20-second gap with engaging micro-content. Whether it’s a quick reflex game, a stoic quote, or a tech headline, it gives your brain just enough stimulation to stay engaged without leaving your workflow. Don’t let the waiting gap break your flow.

FocusWhileAI is a smart Chrome extension that detects when AI models are generating responses and temporarily overlays a personalized, glanceable feed of micro-engagements. The moment the response is ready, it disappears, keeping you focused, present, and in flow.
